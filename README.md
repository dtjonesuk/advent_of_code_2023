# Advent of Code 2023

This year I'll be participating in Advent of Code. Each day I'll be attempting the puzzles and posting my solutions
here, together with a small pr√©cis of the approach used, hurdles overcome, and lessons learned.

My language of choice is C++ and I have developed a minimal boilerplate template to facilitate setting up each day. (
See `main.cpp` and `advent.h` for details).
